    <p>List of most abilties I can use during combat</p>

    <h2>Primary Lotus</h2>
    <p>Primary Lotus is a very powerful ability.
        In fact, if I am successfully able to catch my opponent of guard, it can possibly kill them.
        Firstly, I bring the opponent into the air. This is done through throwing them, knocking them upward, or even just waiting for them to jump by themselves.
        After this, I can wrap my fake bandages around them, completely unarming them. Lastly, I grab them, turn them into a nosedive, and begin rapidly spinning, drilling them into the floor.</p>
    
    <h2>Eight Gates</h2>
    <p>The Eight Gates are a last resort, yet is still very powerful.
        I can open a gate by reaching deep within myself and unleashing a bunch of concentrated spiritual energy.
        Upon opening a gate, my strength, speed, and endurance will increase significantly.
        The side effects to this incredible ability, however, can be quite dire.
        The ability consumes large amounts of chakra, meaning that the longer I stay in the upgraded form, the higher risk there is to my body.
        Opening the Eighth Gate is a guaranteed death after a specific amount of time.
        However, if the circumstances require it, I will use this ability.
    
    <h2>Drunken Warrior</h2>
    <p>This ability is relatively straightforward.
        Upon consuming any amount of alocohol, I will gain immense power.
        This means increasing my speed, strength, and reflexes to ungodly levels.
        However, using this ability also makes me completely unconsious.
        I will be unable to make any choices, and I also might attempt to fight my own squad members.</p>
